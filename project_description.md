# **Vision**

Our project is a card database which a user can organize a card collection with and trade it with other users. 
This product is for the following two users:
  1. Trading Card Game Players. These are players who aim to organize and keep track of their physical collection. They may also enjoy theory-crafting and      building decks.
  2. Trading Card Game Collectors. These are players who collect cards more than they play, and would greatly benefit from a tracked collection.
  
This software significantly simplifies the process of tracking and organizing a collection. There currently is not an easy to use, efficient method of keeping a digital collection. Players currently use either Microsoft Excel or less optimal solutions like MTGGoldfish's collection feature. Our software will fulfill players' needs for a better card collection software.
